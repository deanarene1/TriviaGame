# TriviaGame

In this game, the user is required to answer a series of questions in a given amount of time (2 minutes). I used JavaScript to create a timer that counts down from two minutes to zero. Once the timer reaches 0 seconds, the game ends and shows the amount of incorrect and correct answers.
